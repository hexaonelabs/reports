## Executive Summary

This investment letter provides a forward-looking analysis of DeFi yield strategies for November 2025, with a focus on **stable, reproducible, and high-yield opportunities** across **Arbitrum** and **Base** networks. Our objective remains clear: empower members of our private investment club with **consistent income streams** and **defensive yield farming configurations** designed to outperform market volatility.

The DeFi market continues to evolve under macroeconomic tension and market uncertainty. Despite recent drawdowns, on-chain indicators suggest that the market has **not yet entered a long-term top phase**. While short-term sentiment is fragile, structural fundamentals remain intact — offering yield-focused investors a unique opportunity to accumulate and compound.

For this edition, we present two core strategies:
- **Stablecoin Strategy** targeting **10–18% blended APY**, leveraging Pendle, Morpho and Euler across Arbitrum and Base.
- **BTC, ETH Strategy** optimized for correlated LP exposure and sustainable compounding.

Our thesis remains **risk-adjusted yield optimization**: balancing attractive APY with smart contract reliability and liquidity depth. Every configuration remains **non-custodial**, **transparent**, and **verifiable on-chain**.

## Market Overview

The first days of November have seen renewed market stress, as global risk assets faced sharp pullbacks triggered by renewed geopolitical uncertainty and institutional outflows. Bitcoin retraced below $100,000 after failing to hold the $109,000 zone, while Ethereum fell back toward arround $3,000. Despite this short-term weakness, on-chain data indicates **no weekly structural distribution pattern** consistent with a market top.

The **MVRV ratio** and **Pi Cycle indicators** both remain well below historical overvaluation levels, while **realized cap** data shows net accumulation among long-term holders. This suggests that current volatility may represent a mid-cycle shakeout rather than a macro reversal of trend or the very early stages of a pre-distribution phase.

Institutional behavior remains mixed. ETF flows turned negative for the first time in months, while DeFi liquidity depth increased on Base and Arbitrum as risk capital rotated toward yield-based strategies. Funding rates on major perpetual markets turned neutral after two weeks of elevated longs, reflecting the **market's search for equilibrium**.

**Outlook for November 2025:**
- Short-term volatility expected to persist due to macro uncertainty.
- On-chain accumulation signals remain positive.
- Yield-bearing stablecoins and ETH, BTC LP positions expected to outperform directional longs.

Our positioning remains **defensive-yield-oriented**, emphasizing **cash-flow generation** and **capital preservation** while waiting for confirmation of a renewed bullish impulse.

## Stablecoin Strategy

### Protocol Selection

**Target APY:** 10%–18% blended

**Selected Protocols:**

**On Arbitrum:**
- **Pendle PT thBILL (27th Nov 2025):** Fixed yield around **14.2% APY**, backed by institutional-grade tokenized U.S. Treasury bills. Ideal for monthly-term, fixed-yield positioning. This position can be used as collateral with Euler for build leverage strategies.
- **Morpho USDC Gauntlet Vault:** Optimized lending exposure at **10.8% APY** with on-chain risk scoring and automated rebalancing.

**On Base:**
- **Morpho High Yield Clearstar USDC Vault:** Currently yielding **13.0% APY**, benefiting from Base’s lower transaction costs and active incentives.
- **Pendle PT-sUSDai (20th Nov 2025):** Fixed **32.4% APY**, providing yield certainty and exposure to synthetic dollar protocol designed to finance the physical infrastructure of AI (Compute) and other emerging sectors. sUSDai is the yield-bearing token backed by income-generating Compute or other infrastructure assets. This position is ideal for higher-yield, short-term allocations due to the quality of underlying collateral.
- **Pendle PT thBILL (27th Nov 2025):** Fixed yield around **14.2% APY**, backed by institutional-grade tokenized U.S. Treasury bills. Ideal for monthly-term, fixed-yield positioning.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. Bridge stablecoins (USDC, USDT, or USDai) to Arbitrum and Base using **official bridges or Jumper Exchange**.
2. Allocate **35%** to Pendle fixed-yield PT positions.
3. Allocate **65%** to Morpho lending vaults for steady compounding.
4. Monitor positions weekly and compound rewards automatically where available. You can use max 50% of rewards to invest into others strategies or invest into blueships assets that can be used as collateral on lending protocols.

### Risk Analysis

| Risk Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Maturity Risk | PT tokens have fixed expiry dates; early exits may cause yield loss. |
| Smart Contract Risk | All protocols audited, but DeFi automation introduces non-zero risk. |
| Liquidity Risk | Limited liquidity may impact exit timing. |
| Incentive Volatility | Yields fluctuate based on token emission schedules. |
| Underlying Asset Risk | Stablecoins may face depegging in extreme market conditions. |

### Mitigation Strategies
- Diversify exposure across 3+ positions.
- Track maturity dates and exit 1-5 days before expiration.
- Maintain minimum 50% in lower-risk Morpho pools.
- Periodically convert incentive tokens to stable assets to lock yield.

**Target Outcome:** ~18% blended APY with controlled risk exposure and reproducible execution.

## BTC & ETH Strategy

### Protocol Selection

**On Arbitrum:**
- **Uniswap V3 WETH-WBTC (0.05% fee tier):** Up to **58–68% APY** for liquidity concentrated within ±12–16% of price range. Rewards amplified via **Merkl** campaign layer.
- **Uniswap V3 WBTC-tBTC (0.01% fee tier):** Up to **6% APY** for liquidity concentrated within ±1–2% of price range. Rewards amplified via **Merkl** campaign layer.

**On Base:**
- **Uniswap V3 cbBTC-WETH (0.05% fee tier):** Historical **55–75% APY** (backtested). for liquidity concentrated within ±10–14% of price range.
- **Morpho Seamless WETH Vault:** Adds an additional **5.65% APY** from lending while maintaining liquid ETH exposure. Rewards amplified via **Merkl** campaign layer.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. Bridge WETH, WBTC or cbBTC to Arbitrum/Base.
2. Deploy **30–40%** of total BTC/ETH allocation to Uniswap LPs.
3. Deploy **60–70%** into Morpho lending pairs for base yield.
4. Monitor positions weekly, claim rewards and swap as Stablecoin to inject into Stable strategy.
5. Adjust LP range monthly to follow 14-day moving average.

### Risk Analysis
- **Impermanent Loss:** Even correlated assets can temporarily decouple.
- **Volatility Risk:** Narrow LP ranges increase yield but risk being out-of-range.
- **Liquidity and Smart Contract Risk:** Uniswap and Aave are audited, but exposure persists.
- **Reward Volatility:** Incentive tokens may fluctuate in value.

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use broad LP ranges (±12%) to limit rebalancing.
- Rebalance monthly instead of weekly to reduce transaction drag.
- Hedge exposure by converting a portion of rewards into stablecoins.
- Avoid leverage unless fully collateralized and risk-managed.
- Consider using WETH or WBTC as debit collateral on AAVE, Euler to reduce impermanent loss exposure during market downturns.

**Expected Outcome:** A balanced ETH, BTC yield strategy generating **10–50% APY**, combining liquidity rewards and base lending yields.
