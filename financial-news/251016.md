## Executive Summary

This week’s investment letter focuses on profitable and reproducible DeFi strategies designed for consistent, risk-adjusted growth across Ethereum, Base, and Arbitrum ecosystems. The goal is to empower members of our private investment club with reliable income opportunities and scalable methods to diversify portfolio yield.

DeFi markets continue to mature, with stablecoin yields surpassing 10% APY through automated yield aggregators and cross-chain optimization tools. Platforms such as Yearn, Curve, and Aave maintain their leadership in security and efficiency, while newer protocols on Base and Arbitrum bring fresh incentive programs and concentrated liquidity features. This environment enables investors to build sustainable returns without taking excessive directional exposure.

For crypto-asset positions, ETH and BTC yield generation remains centered around staking, liquidity provisioning, and lending. Combining liquid staking solutions like Lido or Rocket Pool with decentralized exchanges (Uniswap v3/v4) or lending protocols (Aave, Morpho) allows for balanced exposure to both returns and liquidity. Our recommended approach is a defensive yield farming strategy — focusing on low-risk stablecoin farming, combined with uncorrelated yield from ETH/BTC pools.

The ultimate objective of this week’s strategies is to provide a reliable double-digit APY anchored in smart contract security, proven liquidity, and automated compounding. All configurations can be reproduced independently by club members through non-custodial protocols, keeping full on-chain transparency and asset control.

## Market Overview

The crypto market began October with significant volatility, triggered by a historic liquidation event that wiped out over $20 billion from the sector and saw sharp drawdowns in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and major altcoins. Bitcoin crashed from above $123,000 to a low near $105,000 before bouncing back above $114,000. Similarly, Ethereum plunged about 11%, bottoming out below $3,900 but quickly recovering above $4,100. Solana and HYPE from Hyperliquid also recorded drops of up to 30% before finding relative stability.​

Market sentiment shifted rapidly due to geopolitical tensions—particularly new U.S.-China tech tariffs—and institutional ETF outflows, which intensified downside pressure. Despite these headwinds, key technical indicators now show early signs of stabilization, driven by a reduction in market leverage and gradual re-entry from institutional investors. Over half of the leading 100 tokens lost value, but some, like TAO and selected altcoins (MORPHO, SYRUP), posted meaningful gains during periods of increased volatility.​

Looking ahead, analysts expect short-term volatility to persist, especially as the market awaits major macroeconomic events such as the anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve rate decision at the end of October. If monetary easing leads to greater risk appetite, crypto assets could resume upward traction, with Bitcoin possibly revisiting the $120,000–$130,000 channel and Ethereum targeting $4,300 in the coming weeks. Nonetheless, residual risks from global tensions and uncertain regulatory developments remain in play, reinforcing the need for careful risk management and diversification.​

Overall, the outlook for the remainder of October is cautiously optimistic. The market is clearing excess leverage, recovering from its recent shock, and positioning for potential medium-term growth should macro conditions improve and regulatory clarity advance.​

## Stablecoin Strategy
### Protocol Selection
The current stablecoin landscape offers exceptional yield opportunities across both Arbitrum and Base networks. Our selection criteria prioritize protocols with proven track records, substantial liquidity, and sustainable tokenomics. For October 2025, we've identified five high-yield strategies that consistently deliver double-digit APYs while maintaining reasonable risk profiles.

On Arbitrum, Pendle Finance stands out with PT-USDai positions yielding over 30% fixed APY, while Morpho and Balancer/Aura provide more conservative alternatives with steady returns. Base network offers competitive opportunities through Morpho's vault ecosystem and Pendle's yield tokenization, creating a balanced portfolio approach across both chains.

#### On Arbitrum network:
- Pendle PT-USDai (Nov 20, 2025): Currently offering 40,28% fixed APY with $130M+ liquidity. Purchase PT-USDai tokens through Pendle's interface to lock in fixed yields until maturity. This strategy capitalizes on yield curve positioning and benefits from USDai's native staking rewards.​
- Balancer auraGHO/USDT/USDC Vault: Access this pool through Aura Finance for additional incentive rewards. The tripool design minimizes impermanent loss while capturing trading fees and AURA token emissions. Expected combined APY ranges from 10-18% depending on incentive schedules.
- Morpho GauntletUSDC Core Vault: Delivering a steady 9.95% APY through optimized lending strategies. This vault automatically rebalances between different lending protocols to maximize returns while maintaining USDC exposure.​

#### On Base network:
- Morpho High Yield Clearstar USDC Vault: Generating 9.29% APY through institutional-grade lending optimization. The vault leverages Base's lower gas costs and emerging DeFi ecosystem incentives.
- Pendle PT-yoUSD (Mar 26, 2026): Offering 11.59% fixed APY with longer maturity providing yield certainty through Q1 2026. This position benefits from Base's growing yield-bearing stablecoin ecosystem.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

- Bridge stablecoins to target chains using official bridges or Defiway
- Connect browser wallet/hardware wallet to respective protocols
- Allocate 40% to high-yield opportunities (Pendle PT tokens)
- Distribute remaining 60% across Morpho vaults and Balancer pools
- Monitor positions weekly and compound rewards automatically where available. You can use max 50% of rewards to invest into others strategies or invest into blueships assets

### Risk Analysis

#### High-Yield Risks (Pendle PT-USDai 30%+ APY):
- Maturity Risk: PT tokens have fixed maturity dates (Nov 20, 2025). Early exit may result in principal loss if implied APY drops significantly.​
- Protocol Risk: Pendle's yield tokenization introduces smart contract complexity. While audited, the protocol carries inherent technical risks.
- Liquidity Risk: Though currently $130M+ liquidity exists, market stress could impact exit options.​

#### Medium-Risk Strategies (Morpho Vaults 9-10% APY):
- Lending Risk: Vaults optimize across multiple lending protocols, introducing counterparty risk from underlying borrowers.
- Automation Risk: Automated rebalancing depends on keeper networks and governance decisions.
#### Lower-Risk Options (Balancer/Aura 12-18% APY):
- Impermanent Loss: Tripool design minimizes but doesn't eliminate IL risk between stablecoins.
- Token Incentive Risk: AURA rewards may fluctuate based on protocol governance and market conditions.

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Diversify across multiple protocols and chains
- Monitor maturity dates and market conditions closely
- Maintain 20% allocation in lower-risk strategies
- Minimal portfolio rebalancing based on risk-adjusted returns

> The recommended allocation splits 40% across high-yield Pendle positions, 35% in Morpho vaults, and 25% in Balancer/Aura pools, providing balanced risk-return optimization while targeting 15%+ blended APY

## BTC & ETH Strategy
### Protocol Selection
For October 2025, Arbitrum and Base present highly competitive opportunities for yield farming with BTC and ETH pairs. 

#### On Arbitrum:
- Uniswap V3 WBTC-tBTC (0.05% fee tier): $2.35M TVL, with ~3.13% APY in rewards paid out in tBTC, amplified through Merkl's reward layer.
- Uniswap V3 WETH-WBTC (0.05% fee tier): $60.62M TVL, currently achieving up to 63.82% annualized returns (APY) in WBTC and WETH for LPs concentrating their position within a ±12% band around the 14-day price average (highly optimized backtesting).

#### On Base network:
- Uniswap V3 cbBTC-WETH (0.30% fee tier): $6.1M TVL, with impressive 79.82% APY (backtested) for LPs providing liquidity within a ±12% range around the recent mean price. Rewards are distributed in cbBTC and WETH.

#### On All EVM major network:
- Liquid staking with Lido (stETH), Rocket Pool (rETH) or others majors protocol give you a basic staking APY around 3.2%. Then use your liquid tokens with Defi protocol like AAVE to build lending/borrowing strategy.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

- Bridge tokens to target chains using secure bridges like Jumper
- Connect wallet to respective protocols
- Allocate 25% to high-yield opportunities (Uniswap Pools)
- Distribute remaining 75% on AAVE to build your lending/borrowing strategy
- Monitor positions weekly, claim rewards and swap as Stablecoin to inject into Stable strategy.

### Risk Analysis
#### Impermanent Loss:
For both WBTC/tBTC and WETH/WBTC pools, impermanent loss remains the primary risk. When price divergence occurs between paired assets, liquidity providers may receive fewer tokens upon withdrawal than initially deposited. Even highly correlated pairs like WBTC/tBTC can temporarily decouple if liquidity shifts or market activity on one synthetic (like tBTC) diverges from Bitcoin spot performance.​

#### Range and Volatility Risk:
Narrow liquidity ranges may increase short-term returns but expose the position to higher risk of going out of range during volatile market phases. Once out of range, assets remain idle, generating no trading fees. Wider ranges reduce this risk but lower overall APY potential.​

#### Market and Price Depeg Risk:
Liquid staking tokens such as stETH and rETH may temporarily diverge from the price of ETH, creating short-term liquidity or volatility risks. This often occurs during high withdrawal demand or network congestion phases, and while arbitrage helps restore parity, it’s not instantaneous.

#### Liquidity Risk and Exit Limitation:
While liquid staking provides flexibility, momentary scarcity of ETH or limited secondary market liquidity can delay conversions between stETH/rETH and ETH. This could lock capital temporarily and hinder rapid redeployment into new DeFi opportunities.

#### Smart Contract and Protocol Risk:
While Uniswap V3 is audited and battle-tested, the ecosystem still carries technical and governance risks — especially when paired with external reward layers (e.g., Merkl). A bug, governance proposal, or oracle issue could affect either the reward distribution or pool balance.​

#### Reward and Market Correlation Risk:
Rewards denominated in volatile assets (tBTC, WBTC, WETH) may significantly fluctuate in USD value. This volatility can erode effective APY during bearish periods. Maintaining higher correlation pairs like WETH/WBTC mitigates exposure, but not entirely — large BTC/ETH ratio swings can still impact LP performance.

### Mitigation Strategies
- Maintain broad liquidity ranges to reduce rebalancing frequency and limit IL exposure.
- Focus on correlated pairs (e.g., WBTC/tBTC) and pools with high daily fee-to-TVL ratios.
- Regularly swap accumulated rewards into stablecoins to lock in profits.
- Reinvest stable assets into lower-risk stablecoin strategies to stabilize overall yield.
- Avoid Over-leverage: Do not borrow assets to boost LP size without clear strategy, as this can magnify losses if market moves against your position.

These strategies enable advanced LPs to consistently extract high returns on bluechip assets while controlling risks inherent to yield farming and market volatility.

## Bonus Section
Delta-Neutral Yield Using Hyperhedge & Hyperliquid Liquidity Pool (HLP)

### Hyperhedge on Hyperliquid
Hyperhedge is a specialized platform offering delta-neutral yield farming strategies on the Hyperliquid ecosystem. By simultaneously taking offsetting long and short positions on assets such as $BTC and $ETH, Hyperhedge eliminates directional risk and earns returns mainly from funding fees and protocol incentives.
- Performance: In September 2025, Hyperhedge achieved a strong APY of over 18%, delivering consistent returns regardless of market price movements.
- Mechanics: The platform automates position management to capture funding rate inefficiencies on Hyperliquid's decentralized perpetual futures market, reducing manual effort and exposure to volatility.
  
> Delta-neutral setup minimizes risk, offers steady income in any market direction, and provides exposure to the growing Hyperliquid ecosystem.

### Hyperliquid Liquidity Pool (HLP)
The HLP token represents liquidity provision directly on Hyperliquid’s decentralized exchange. 
- HLP holders earn yield from market-making profits and funding fees.
- While HLP delivered excellent returns in recent months, its APY is expected to decline due to tapering rewards and market maturation.

> HLP is therefore best seen as a non-directional exposure to trading volume and liquidity provision.
